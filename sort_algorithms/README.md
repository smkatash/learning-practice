# sorting_algorithms

In order to learn/understand better the implementation of sorting algorithms at the start of my programming journey (while styding at 42Heilbronn)
i implemened O(n), O(nlgn), and O(n^2) sorting algorithms in C with explicit explanation.


## [O-n](O(n))
#### Counting Sort
Counting sort is a non comparison based linear time sorting algorithm for cases where the input elements are in a limited range, usually with a given maximum limit.

#### Radix Sort
Radix sort is algorithm like counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm if your data is within a limited range.

#### Bucket Sort
Bucket sort is a sorting algorithm which works in linear time when the data is uniformly distributed across a range.

## [O-n^2](O(n^2))
in Progress..
